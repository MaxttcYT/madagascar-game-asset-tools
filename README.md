# MADAGASCAR BSP PARSER

1. Put all BSPS from a level into `bsps/`
2. Put all TEXTURES from a level into `parsed_bsps/textures/` in PNG format
3. Run `parse_bsps.py`
4. You can now import all into blender or something other but exclude the obj with `_COL` in its name, its for collision and hidden in game
5. It should correctly show geometry but textures witll be messed up
